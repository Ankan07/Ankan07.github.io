                                &lt;p&gt;Ever since the enactment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (&amp;ldquo;&lt;b&gt;IBC&lt;/b&gt;&amp;rdquo;), the law relating to insolvency in India has been constantly evolving, with each successive amendment and judicial pronouncements.&amp;nbsp; Insolvency law is at a stage where the legislature as well as courts are continuously developing better precedents for streamlining the corporate insolvency resolution process (&amp;ldquo;&lt;b&gt;CIRP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;rdquo;).&amp;nbsp; The introduction of Section 29A in the IBC was such an effort made by the legislature with the intention to render unscrupulous resolution applicants as ineligible from presenting a resolution plan and taking over the affairs of a corporate debtor.&amp;nbsp; The Supreme Court of India in &lt;em&gt;ArcelorMittal India Private Limited v. Satish Kumar Gupta and Ors.&lt;/em&gt; (Civil Appeal Nos. 9402-9405 of 2018) considered the case of two such resolution applicants, ArcelorMittal India Private Limited (&amp;ldquo;&lt;b&gt;AMIPL&lt;/b&gt;&amp;rdquo;) and Numetal Limited (&amp;ldquo;&lt;b&gt;Numetal&lt;/b&gt;&amp;rdquo;), who were declared to be ineligible by the Resolution Professional. Apart from adjudicating upon the ineligibility of AMIPL and Numetal, the Supreme Court in its decision has also considered important issues such as: (i) the relevant time of considering ineligibility under Section 29A; (ii) the principle of piercing the corporate veil; (iii) &amp;ldquo;connected persons&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;persons acting in concert&amp;rdquo; under Section 29A; (iv) the objective of Section 29A and the powers of a Resolution Professional thereunder and (v) time-bound disposal of CIRP.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In order to better appreciate the reasons for declaring AMIPL and Numetal ineligible, a narration of facts is necessary. Given the complexity of the transactions relating to the two entities, this post is divided into two parts. Part-1 shall deal with transactions pertaining to AMIPL and the issues considered by the Supreme Court in the context of AMIPL&amp;rsquo;s disqualification.&amp;nbsp; Part-2 will consider in detail the facts pertaining to Numetal&amp;rsquo;s ineligibility and the issues considered by the Supreme Court in relation thereto.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Background&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;An application was filed under Section 7 of the IBC at the behest of State Bank of India and Standard Chartered Bank to initiate CIRP against Essar Steel India Limited (&amp;ldquo;&lt;b&gt;ESIL&lt;/b&gt;&amp;rdquo;) for debts of approximately 45,000 crores. The application under Section 7 was admitted and Mr. Satish Kumar Gupta was appointed as an interim resolution professional, later on confirmed as the Resolution Professional (&amp;ldquo;&lt;b&gt;RP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;rdquo;). The RP published an advertisement on 6.10.2017 seeking expression of interest (&amp;ldquo;&lt;b&gt;EOI&lt;/b&gt;&amp;rdquo;) from potential resolution applicants who wished to submit resolution plans for the revival of ESIL. Pursuant to this advertisement, AMIPL and Numetal submitted their respective EOIs on 20.10.2017, and the Resolution Plans for each were submitted on 12.02.2018. However, on 23.03.2018, the RP found that both AMIPL and Numetal were ineligible on the following grounds:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;AMIPL was a connected person to ArcelorMittal Netherlands (&amp;ldquo;&lt;b&gt;AM Netherlands&lt;/b&gt;&amp;rdquo;). AM Netherlands was a promoter of Uttam Galva Steels Limited (&amp;ldquo;&lt;b&gt;Uttam Galva&lt;/b&gt;&amp;rdquo;), whose account had been classified as a &amp;lsquo;non-performing asset&amp;rsquo; on 31.03.2016 by Canara Bank and Punjab National Bank.&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftn1&#34; name=&#34;_ftnref1&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; AMIPL was, therefore, held to be ineligible under Section 29A(c) of the IBC. AMIPL, a group company of Shri L.N. Mittal, was also held to be disqualified due to its connection with KSS Petron, declared to be NPA more than a year prior to the commencement of CIRP.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt; &lt;li&gt;Numetal was declared ineligible because it relied on Essar Communications Ltd. (&amp;ldquo;&lt;b&gt;ECL&lt;/b&gt;&amp;rdquo;) to meet the eligibility requirement of &amp;lsquo;tangible net worth&amp;rsquo; for submission of a resolution plan. Further, Numetal was held by one of the companies controlled by Mr. Ravi Ruia, son of Mr. Rewant Ruia, promoter of ESIL. ESIL&amp;rsquo;s account was itself declared as an NPA on 02.08.2017. According to the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011, Mr. Ravi Ruia was deemed to be a person acting in concert with his father, and would be ineligible under Section 29A (c) and (h) of the IBC.&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftn2&#34; name=&#34;_ftnref2&#34;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When the matter reached the National Company Law Tribunal (&amp;ldquo;&lt;b&gt;NCLT&lt;/b&gt;&amp;rdquo;), it was held that Numetal was a distinct corporate entity and could not be considered as a consortium of its shareholders, and therefore, Mr. Ravi Ruia&amp;rsquo;s shareholding in Numetal should e irrelevant. The NCLT also held that AMIPL would be ineligible because it was connected to KSS Petron, a company declared as NPA. The matter was remanded to the Committee of Creditors (&amp;ldquo;&lt;b&gt;CoC&lt;/b&gt;&amp;rdquo;) and the RP for reconsideration because the NCLT held that irrespective of the ineligibility, the RP should have produced both the resolution plans before the CoC.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;An appeal was filed by Numetal and AMIPL before the NCLAT. As regards Numetal&amp;rsquo;s ineligibility, the NCLAT on 07.09.2018 held that one of Mr. Ravi Ruia&amp;rsquo;s companies was not a shareholder of Numetal Ltd. on 29.03.2018, the date of submission of Numetal&amp;rsquo;s resolution plan Therefore, the NCLAT was of the view that Numetal&amp;rsquo;s resolution plan should be considered by the CoC. The NCLT&amp;rsquo;s order declaring AMIPL to be ineligible was upheld, however AMIPL was given an opportunity to make all payments of overdue amounts in relation to its NPA to rid of its ineligibility under Section 30(4) of the IBC.&amp;nbsp; Against the NCLAT&amp;rsquo;s order dated 07.09.2018, an appeal was filed before the Supreme Court by AMIPL.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Transactions relating to AMIPL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The shareholding pattern and transactions in relation to AMIPL and Uttam Galva is shown as under:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gavel-and-beyond.appspot.com/o/pic1.PNG?alt=media&amp;token=5538ea1d-b16d-4504-880d-bbcc667a9561&#34;&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As has been mentioned above, Uttam Galva was declared as NPA on 31.03.2016 with an oustanding debt of around INR 6000 crores. A few days before submission of the resolution plan, AM Netherlands sold its entire shareholding in Uttam Galva by way of an off-market sale to a company of its co-promoter, Sainath Trading Company Private Limited for INR 1/- while the said shares were acquired at a value of INR 120/- each and their market value as on date was INR 19.50/- per share. AM Netherlands enjoyed the position of a co-promoter in Uttam Galva before the sale of its shareholding and was entitled to nominate one half of the non-independent directors on the board of Uttam Galva. Affirmative vote of AM Netherlands was also required for certain matters of Uttam Galva. Mr. L.N. Mittal was the ultimate shareholder of AMIPL as well as that of AM Netherlands.&amp;nbsp; In this context, the NCLAT had declared AMIPL to be ineligible under Section 29A(c) until payment of all overdue amount with interest and charges relating to the NPA account of Uttam Galva.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;AMIPL was also held to be connected to another company, KSS Petron which was declared to be NPA on 30.09.2015:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gavel-and-beyond.appspot.com/o/pic2.PNG?alt=media&amp;token=7bd03548-7820-4852-895a-674bbb417e37&#34;&gt;   &lt;p&gt;AMIPL was a group company of Shri L.N. Mittal. Similarly, KSS Petron was also an indirect subsidiary of Fraseli, another L.N. Mittal group company.. The NCLAT had held that L.N. Mittal was a connected person of AMIPL and was also in control and management of KSS Petron since 2011. It was further held that even if there was a divestment of the shares of KSS Petron (declared as an NPA) by KSS Global, the stigma attached to AMIPL could not be cleared.&amp;nbsp; AMIPL was therefore held to be ineligible under Clause 29A(c) until the payment of all overdue amount with interest thereon and charges relating to the NPA account of KSS Petron.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Arguments raised in favour of AMIPL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;AMIPL&amp;rsquo;s eligibility was defended primarily on the ground that the relevant time to consider the ineligibility under Section 29A should be at the stage of submission of the resolution plan.&amp;nbsp; It was stated that in 2015 itself AM Netherlands had written off the investment in Uttam Galva from its books and had sought to exit from the company. On 07.02.2018, AM Netherlands had also transferred its entire shareholding in Uttam Galva to Sainath Trading Company Pvt. Ltd. and had ceased to be a promoter prior to the submission of the resolution plan. Similarly, in the case of KSS Petron and Fraseli, the entire shareholding of Fraseli in KSS Global was transferred back to KSS Global on 09.02.2018, i.e., before submission of the resolution plan.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;What is the relevant time to consider ineligibility under Section 29A&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court considered the plain language of Section 29A which states that &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;a person shall not be eligible to submit a resolution plan&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;. &lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;This made it clear that the stage of ineligibility would attach when the resolution plan is submitted by the resolution applicant.&amp;nbsp; The date of CIRP would only be relevant for the purpose of calculating whether one year had lapsed from the date of classification of a person as NPA.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Given the object and purpose of Section 29A, the Supreme Court further held that it would be important to ensure that persons who are otherwise ineligible under Section 29A(c) are not allowed to wriggle out of the consequences provided thereunder. The objective and purpose of Section 29A was to check that undesirable persons repay overdue amounts before submitting their resolution plan. Therefore, despite the relevant time for ineligibility being considered at the time of submission of the resolution plan, certain antecedent facts reasonably proximate to the time of submission of the plan could be taken into consideration. This was done to avoid a situation where a person otherwise ineligible to submit a resolution plan arranges its affairs in a manner so as to avoid paying off the debts of the NPA.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court concluded in the context of AMIPL that the sale of shares in Uttam Galva owned by AM Netherlands was carried out only to get out of the ineligibility mentioned under Section 29A(c). Similarly, the sale of Fraseli&amp;rsquo;s shareholding in KSS Global alongwith the resignation of Mittal directors from the board of KSS Global was a transaction reasonably proximate to the date of submission of the resolution plan by MIPL.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As has been mentioned above, the Supreme Court considered various other issues on the interpretation of Section 29A.&amp;nbsp; These issues, which &lt;em&gt;inter alia&lt;/em&gt; pertain to the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil, and the meaning of &amp;ldquo;connected persons&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;persons acting in concert&amp;rdquo; were considered predominantly in the context of Numetal&amp;rsquo;s ineligibility, and shall be considered in the next part of this post.&lt;/p&gt;  &gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftnref1&#34; name=&#34;_ftn1&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &amp;nbsp;Subsequently, on default of loan the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) admitted an Insolvency Petition filed by State Bank of India (SBI) against Uttam Galva. This insolvency petition was subsequently withdrawn by SBI after ArcelorMittal paid INR 7,469 Crores to clear the outstanding dues of Uttam Galva and KSS Petron. These events transpired after the judgment under discussion was passed by the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftnref2&#34; name=&#34;_ftn2&#34;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; Numetal&amp;rsquo;s ineligibility and the various issues relating thereto, including the SAST Regulations, will be discussed in the next part of the post. This post only discusses AMIPL&amp;rsquo;s ineligibility.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;style&gt;   img {     max-width: 100%;     height: auto;     width: auto\9; /* ie8 */ } &lt;/style&gt;

The RP published an advertisement on 6.10.2017 seeking expression of interest (&amp;ldquo;&lt;b&gt;EOI&lt;/b&gt;&amp;rdquo;) from potential resolution applicants who wished to submit resolution plans for the revival of ESIL. Pursuant to this advertisement, AMIPL and Numetal submitted their respective EOIs on 20.10.2017, and the Resolution Plans for each were submitted on 12.02.2018. However, on 23.03.2018, the RP found that both AMIPL and Numetal were ineligible on the following grounds:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;AMIPL was a connected person to ArcelorMittal Netherlands (&amp;ldquo;&lt;b&gt;AM Netherlands&lt;/b&gt;&amp;rdquo;). AM Netherlands was a promoter of Uttam Galva Steels Limited (&amp;ldquo;&lt;b&gt;Uttam Galva&lt;/b&gt;&amp;rdquo;), whose account had been classified as a &amp;lsquo;non-performing asset&amp;rsquo; on 31.03.2016 by Canara Bank and Punjab National Bank.&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftn1&#34; name=&#34;_ftnref1&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; AMIPL was, therefore, held to be ineligible under Section 29A(c) of the IBC. AMIPL, a group company of Shri L.N. Mittal, was also held to be disqualified due to its connection with KSS Petron, declared to be NPA more than a year prior to the commencement of CIRP.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt; &lt;li&gt;Numetal was declared ineligible because it relied on Essar Communications Ltd. (&amp;ldquo;&lt;b&gt;ECL&lt;/b&gt;&amp;rdquo;) to meet the eligibility requirement of &amp;lsquo;tangible net worth&amp;rsquo; for submission of a resolution plan. Further, Numetal was held by one of the companies controlled by Mr. Ravi Ruia, son of Mr. Rewant Ruia, promoter of ESIL. ESIL&amp;rsquo;s account was itself declared as an NPA on 02.08.2017. According to the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011, Mr. Ravi Ruia was deemed to be a person acting in concert with his father, and would be ineligible under Section 29A (c) and (h) of the IBC.&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftn2&#34; name=&#34;_ftnref2&#34;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When the matter reached the National Company Law Tribunal (&amp;ldquo;&lt;b&gt;NCLT&lt;/b&gt;&amp;rdquo;), it was held that Numetal was a distinct corporate entity and could not be considered as a consortium of its shareholders, and therefore, Mr. Ravi Ruia&amp;rsquo;s shareholding in Numetal should e irrelevant. The NCLT also held that AMIPL would be ineligible because it was connected to KSS Petron, a company declared as NPA. The matter was remanded to the Committee of Creditors (&amp;ldquo;&lt;b&gt;CoC&lt;/b&gt;&amp;rdquo;) and the RP for reconsideration because the NCLT held that irrespective of the ineligibility, the RP should have produced both the resolution plans before the CoC.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;An appeal was filed by Numetal and AMIPL before the NCLAT. As regards Numetal&amp;rsquo;s ineligibility, the NCLAT on 07.09.2018 held that one of Mr. Ravi Ruia&amp;rsquo;s companies was not a shareholder of Numetal Ltd. on 29.03.2018, the date of submission of Numetal&amp;rsquo;s resolution plan Therefore, the NCLAT was of the view that Numetal&amp;rsquo;s resolution plan should be considered by the CoC. The NCLT&amp;rsquo;s order declaring AMIPL to be ineligible was upheld, however AMIPL was given an opportunity to make all payments of overdue amounts in relation to its NPA to rid of its ineligibility under Section 30(4) of the IBC.&amp;nbsp; Against the NCLAT&amp;rsquo;s order dated 07.09.2018, an appeal was filed before the Supreme Court by AMIPL.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Transactions relating to AMIPL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The shareholding pattern and transactions in relation to AMIPL and Uttam Galva is shown as under:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gavel-and-beyond.appspot.com/o/pic1.PNG?alt=media&amp;token=5538ea1d-b16d-4504-880d-bbcc667a9561&#34;&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As has been mentioned above, Uttam Galva was declared as NPA on 31.03.2016 with an oustanding debt of around INR 6000 crores. A few days before submission of the resolution plan, AM Netherlands sold its entire shareholding in Uttam Galva by way of an off-market sale to a company of its co-promoter, Sainath Trading Company Private Limited for INR 1/- while the said shares were acquired at a value of INR 120/- each and their market value as on date was INR 19.50/- per share. AM Netherlands enjoyed the position of a co-promoter in Uttam Galva before the sale of its shareholding and was entitled to nominate one half of the non-independent directors on the board of Uttam Galva. Affirmative vote of AM Netherlands was also required for certain matters of Uttam Galva. Mr. L.N. Mittal was the ultimate shareholder of AMIPL as well as that of AM Netherlands.&amp;nbsp; In this context, the NCLAT had declared AMIPL to be ineligible under Section 29A(c) until payment of all overdue amount with interest and charges relating to the NPA account of Uttam Galva.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;AMIPL was also held to be connected to another company, KSS Petron which was declared to be NPA on 30.09.2015:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gavel-and-beyond.appspot.com/o/pic2.PNG?alt=media&amp;token=7bd03548-7820-4852-895a-674bbb417e37&#34;&gt;   &lt;p&gt;AMIPL was a group company of Shri L.N. Mittal. Similarly, KSS Petron was also an indirect subsidiary of Fraseli, another L.N. Mittal group company.. The NCLAT had held that L.N. Mittal was a connected person of AMIPL and was also in control and management of KSS Petron since 2011. It was further held that even if there was a divestment of the shares of KSS Petron (declared as an NPA) by KSS Global, the stigma attached to AMIPL could not be cleared.&amp;nbsp; AMIPL was therefore held to be ineligible under Clause 29A(c) until the payment of all overdue amount with interest thereon and charges relating to the NPA account of KSS Petron.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Arguments raised in favour of AMIPL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;AMIPL&amp;rsquo;s eligibility was defended primarily on the ground that the relevant time to consider the ineligibility under Section 29A should be at the stage of submission of the resolution plan.&amp;nbsp; It was stated that in 2015 itself AM Netherlands had written off the investment in Uttam Galva from its books and had sought to exit from the company. On 07.02.2018, AM Netherlands had also transferred its entire shareholding in Uttam Galva to Sainath Trading Company Pvt. Ltd. and had ceased to be a promoter prior to the submission of the resolution plan. Similarly, in the case of KSS Petron and Fraseli, the entire shareholding of Fraseli in KSS Global was transferred back to KSS Global on 09.02.2018, i.e., before submission of the resolution plan.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;What is the relevant time to consider ineligibility under Section 29A&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court considered the plain language of Section 29A which states that &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;a person shall not be eligible to submit a resolution plan&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;. &lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;This made it clear that the stage of ineligibility would attach when the resolution plan is submitted by the resolution applicant.&amp;nbsp; The date of CIRP would only be relevant for the purpose of calculating whether one year had lapsed from the date of classification of a person as NPA.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Given the object and purpose of Section 29A, the Supreme Court further held that it would be important to ensure that persons who are otherwise ineligible under Section 29A(c) are not allowed to wriggle out of the consequences provided thereunder. The objective and purpose of Section 29A was to check that undesirable persons repay overdue amounts before submitting their resolution plan. Therefore, despite the relevant time for ineligibility being considered at the time of submission of the resolution plan, certain antecedent facts reasonably proximate to the time of submission of the plan could be taken into consideration. This was done to avoid a situation where a person otherwise ineligible to submit a resolution plan arranges its affairs in a manner so as to avoid paying off the debts of the NPA.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court concluded in the context of AMIPL that the sale of shares in Uttam Galva owned by AM Netherlands was carried out only to get out of the ineligibility mentioned under Section 29A(c). Similarly, the sale of Fraseli&amp;rsquo;s shareholding in KSS Global alongwith the resignation of Mittal directors from the board of KSS Global was a transaction reasonably proximate to the date of submission of the resolution plan by MIPL.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As has been mentioned above, the Supreme Court considered various other issues on the interpretation of Section 29A.&amp;nbsp; These issues, which &lt;em&gt;inter alia&lt;/em&gt; pertain to the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil, and the meaning of &amp;ldquo;connected persons&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;persons acting in concert&amp;rdquo; were considered predominantly in the context of Numetal&amp;rsquo;s ineligibility, and shall be considered in the next part of this post.&lt;/p&gt;  &gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftnref1&#34; name=&#34;_ftn1&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &amp;nbsp;Subsequently, on default of loan the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) admitted an Insolvency Petition filed by State Bank of India (SBI) against Uttam Galva. This insolvency petition was subsequently withdrawn by SBI after ArcelorMittal paid INR 7,469 Crores to clear the outstanding dues of Uttam Galva and KSS Petron. These events transpired after the judgment under discussion was passed by the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftnref2&#34; name=&#34;_ftn2&#34;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; Numetal&amp;rsquo;s ineligibility and the various issues relating thereto, including the SAST Regulations, will be discussed in the next part of the post. This post only discusses AMIPL&amp;rsquo;s ineligibility.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;style&gt;   img {     max-width: 100%;     height: auto;     width: auto\9; /* ie8 */ } &lt;/style&gt;
